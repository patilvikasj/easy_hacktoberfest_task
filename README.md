This repo is created to encourage young developers into open-source. Use the strings.xml as example to create a separate xml file for the translation. Also do check out existing translation files for mistakes. PRs will be accepted for major corrections.

This string file contains english translations of Snap Screenshot App that I made to take screenshot of Snapchat without detection. It can also take general screenshots :P
